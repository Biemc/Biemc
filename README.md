Biemc
=====

Biemc is a little programming project by two undergraduate Bioinformatics students. Our ambition is not to create something 
new, but to deepen our programming and nevertheless to improve our teamwork skills by using Github.
Biemc is short for "Bioinformatic is even more complex", which was a frequently used catchphrase by our Bioinformatics professor.
The meaning of this project is to create a Bioinformatics toolbox, which unites many different functions. As we will implemt these 
functions bit by bit, our project might be considered a bottom-up approach. Thus it is also possible, that we will have 
to start anew from time to time. But bear in mind, that this is only a project. 

Project goals
-------------

1. Implement the Smith-Waterman-Algorithm
2. Create a GUI for it
3. Implement some classes for common Bioinformatical entities like sequences
4. Implement a Parser for the FASTA-format
5. Get the implementations working together in a proper manner
(Optional) Create a version of Biemc for Android. Because as you know: Everbody loves Android Apps!
