Biemc
=====

Biemc is a little programming project by two undergraduate Bioinformatics students. Our ambition is not to create something new, but to deepen our programming and nevertheless to improve our teamwork skills by using Github.
Biemc is short for "Bioinformatic is even more complex", which was a frequently used catchphrase by our Bioinformatics professor.

The meaning of this project is to create a Bioinformatics toolbox, which unites many different functions. As we will implemt these functions bit by bit, our project might be considered a bottom-up approach. Thus it is also possible, that we will have to start anew from time to time. But bear in mind, that this is only a project. 
And by the way this project will be mostly written in Java, since we will have a lab course in Spring 2015, where we will
also have to write a little project in Java. And as you know: A bit pratice never hurts anyone.

Current Project goals
---------------------

1. Implement the Smith-Waterman-Algorithm
2. Create a GUI for it
3. Implement some classes for common Bioinformatical entities like sequences
4. Implement a Parser for the FASTA-format
5. Get the implementations working together in a proper manner
(Optional) Create a version of Biemc for Android. Because as you know: Everbody loves Android Apps!
