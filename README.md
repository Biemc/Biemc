Biemc
=====

Background and Philosophy
-------------------------

Biemc is a little programming project by two undergraduate Bioinformatics students. Our ambition is not to create something new, but to deepen our programming skills and nevertheless to improve our capability for teamwork by using Github.
Biemc is short for "Bioinformatics is even more complex", which is a frequently used catchphrase by our Introduction to Bioinformatics professor.

The meaning of this project is to create a Bioinformatics toolbox, which unites many different functions (like common algorithms, parsers and so on). As we will implemt these functions bit by bit, our project might be considered a bottom-up approach. Thus it is also possible, that we will have to start anew from time to time, if the code should get unexpendable. Thus bear in mind, that this is only a pratice project. 
And by the way this project will be mostly written in Java, since we will have a lab course in Spring 2015, where we will
also have to write a little project in Java. And as you know: A bit pratice never hurts anyone.

Current Project Goals
---------------------

1. Implement the Smith-Waterman-Algorithm
2. Create a GUI for it
3. Implement some classes for common Bioinformatical entities like sequences
4. Implement a Parser for the FASTA-format
5. Get the implementations working together in a proper manner

(Optional) Create a version of Biemc for Android. Because as you know: Everbody loves Android Apps!
